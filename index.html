        My goal was to create an ensemble of instruments that work with a wide
        range of user specification. From the moment the user runs the program,
        there is a randomized beat that they can then change live. At their
        most specific, the instruments can be locked to a consistent rhythm or
        pitch. At their least specific, they play along randomly but coherently.<br><br>

        There are four instruments: HH (hi-hat), CC (clap),
        KK (kick), and BB (bass). Each have four main functions:<br>
        <li>gain(float): change instrument gain</li>
        <li>mix(float): change instrument reverb level</li>
        <li>connect(UGen): connect the instrument to other Chuck UGens</li>
        <li>help(): print instrument's functions and argument info</li>
        <li>algo(dur, int, ...): the number of parameters varies per instrument,
            but all include the length of one beat and the number of beats per
            measure. T (0.8s) is the default duration in the terminal looper
            code; all numerical duration inputs are interpreted as being in seconds.
        </li>
        <br>

        KK and CC's algo() also requires the string name of a "style", i.e. basic
        rhythmic structure (4-on-the-floor, reggaeton, backbeat, etc). They also
        have the function randomStyle(), which cycles through these settings for
        however many repetitions is specified.<br><br>

        The way it is set up in Chuck, the duration and number of beats for
        KK controls the length of the other instruments' loops. For example, giving
        the kick 5 beats and the other instruments 4 will result in the 5th beat
        playing the kick and bass (paused on its last note) while the clap
        and hi-hat tacet.

        To run the program, use

        <li><a href="bass.ck">BB</a></li>
        <li><a href="clap.ck">CC</a></li>
        <li><a href="hihat.ck">HH</a></li>
